SubmitButton is a component that renders a button with different states based on
the `state` prop. It can be used to indicate the status of a form submission.

```jsx padded
<SubmitButton state={1} />

<SubmitButton state={2} />

<SubmitButton state={3} />

<SubmitButton label="Submitting" state={2} />
```
